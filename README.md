In this assignment, you will write code to compute an optimal policy for a given MDP using the algorithms that were discussed in class: Value Iteration, Howard‚Äôs Policy Iteration, and Linear Programming. The first part of the assignment is to implement these algorithms. Input to these algorithms will be an MDP and the expected output is the optimal value function, along with an optimal policy.

MDP solvers have a variety of applications. As the second part of this assignment, you will use your solver to find the shortest path between a given start state and an end state in a maze.

Data

The data directory in this compressed directory contains 2 folders: mdp and maze. In the mdp folder, you are given six MDP instances (3 each for continuing and episodic tasks). A correct solution for each MDP is also given in the same folder, which you can use to test your code. In the maze folder, you are given 10 maze instances that you can use to test your code for the maze problem. Your code will also be evaluated on instances other than the ones provided. MDP file format

Each MDP is provided as a text file in the following format.

numStates S

numActions A

start st end ed1 ed2 ‚Ä¶ edn transition s1 ac s2 r p transition s1 ac s2 r p

. . .

. . .

. . .

transition s1 ac s2 r p mdptype mdptype discount gamma

The number of states S and the number of actions A will be integers greater than 1, and at most 100. Assume that the states are numbered 0, 1, ‚Ä¶, S ‚Äì 1, and the actions are numbered 0, 1, ‚Ä¶, A ‚Äì 1. Each line that begins with ‚Äútransition‚Äù gives the reward and transition probability corresponding to a transition, where R(s1, ac, s2) = r and T(s1, ac, s2) = p. Rewards can be positive, negative, or zero. Transitions with zero probabilities are not specified. mdptype will be one of continuing and episodic. The discount factor gamma is a real number between 0 (included) and 1 (included). Recall that gamma is a part of the MDP: you must not change it inside your solver! Also recall that it is okay to use gamma = 1 in episodic tasks that guarantee termination; you will find such an example among the ones given.

st is the start state, which you might need for Task 2 (ignore for Task 1). ed1, ed2,‚Ä¶, edn are the end states (terminal states). For continuing tasks with no terminal states, this list is replaced by -1.

To get familiar with the MDP file format, you can view and run generateMDP.py (provided in the base directory), which is a python script used to generate random MDPs. Specify the number of states and actions, the discount factor, type of mdp (episodic or continuing), and the random seed as command-line arguments to this file. Two examples of how this script can be invoked are given below.

python generateMDP.py ‚ÄìS 2 ‚ÄìA 2 ‚Äìgamma 0.90 ‚Äìmdptype episodic ‚Äìrseed 0 python generateMDP.py ‚ÄìS 50 ‚ÄìA 20 ‚Äìgamma 0.20 ‚Äìmdptype continuing ‚Äìrseed 0

Maze file format

Each maze is provided in a text file as a rectangular grid of 0‚Äôs, 1‚Äôs, 2, and 3‚Äôs. An example is given here along with the visualisation.

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1

1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1

1 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1

1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1

1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1

1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1

1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1

1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Here 0 denotes an empty tile, 1 denotes an obstruction/wall, 2 denotes the start state and 3 denotes an end state. In the visualisation below, the white square is the end position and the yellow one is the start position.

The figure on the right shows the shortest path.

Task 1 ‚Äì MDP Planning Algorithms

Given an MDP, your program must compute the optimal value function V* and an optimal policy œÄ* by applying the algorithm that is specified through the command line. Create a python file called planner.py which accepts the following command-line arguments.

‚Äìmdp followed by a path to the input MDP file, and ‚Äìalgorithm followed by one of vi, hpi, and lp.

Make no assumptions about the location of the MDP file relative to the current working directory; read it in from the path that will be provided. The algorithms specified above correspond to Value Iteration, Howard‚Äôs Policy Iteration, and Linear Programming, respectively. Here are a few examples of how your planner might be invoked (it will always be invoked from its own directory).

python planner.py ‚Äìmdp /home/user/data/mdp-4.txt ‚Äìalgorithm vi python planner.py ‚Äìmdp /home/user/temp/data/mdp-7.txt ‚Äìalgorithm hpi python planner.py ‚Äìmdp /home/user/mdpfiles/mdp-5.txt ‚Äìalgorithm lp

Output Format

The output of your planner must be in the following format and written to standard output.

V*(0) œÄ*(0)

V*(1) œÄ*(1) .

.

.

V*(S ‚Äì 1) œÄ*(S ‚Äì 1)

In the data/mdp directory provided, you will find output files corresponding to the MDP files, which have solutions in the format above.

Note:

1. Your output has to be written to the standard output, not to any file.

2. For values, print at least 6 places after the decimal point. Print more if you‚Äôd like, but 6 (xxx.123456) will suffice.

3. If your code produces output that resembles the solution files: that is, S lines of the form value + ‚Äù ‚Äù + action + ‚Äù ‚Äù or even value + ‚Äù ‚Äù + action + ‚Äù ‚Äù you should be okay. Make sure you don‚Äôt print anything else.

4. If there are multiple optimal policies, feel free to print any one of them.

Task 2 ‚Äì Solving a maze using MDPs

In this task, your objective is to find the shortest path from start to end in a specified maze. The idea is to piggyback on the planner code you have already written in Task 1.

Note: In this task, assume that any invalid move doesn‚Äôt change the state e.g., a right move doesn‚Äôt change the state if there‚Äôs a wall on the immediate right of the current cell.

Your first step is to encode the maze as an MDP (use the same format as described above). Then you will use planner.py to find an optimal policy. Finally, you will simulate the optimal policy on the maze in a deterministic setting to extract a path from start to the end. Note that this path also corresponds to the shortest possible path from start to end. Output the path as:

A0 A1 A2 . . . .

Here ‚ÄúA0 A1 A2 . . .‚Äù is the sequence of moves taken from the start state to reach the end state along the simulated path. Each move must be one of N (north), S (south), E (east), and W (west). See, for example, solution10.txt in the maze directory, for an illustrative solution.

To visualise the maze, use this command. python visualize.py gridfile

To visualise your solution, use this command. python visualize.py gridfile pathfile

Create a python file called encoder.py that will encode the maze as an MDP and output the MDP. The code should run as:

python encoder.py ‚Äìgrid gridfile &gt; mdpfile

We will then run python planner.py ‚Äìmdp mdpfile ‚Äìalgorithm vi &gt; value_and_policy_file.

Also, create a python source file called decoder.py that will simulate the optimal policy and output the path taken between the start and end state given the file value_and_policy_file and the gridfile. The output format should be as specified above. The script should run as follows.

python decoder.py ‚Äìgrid gridfile ‚Äìvalue_policy value_and_policy_file

Submission

There are two python scripts given to verify the correctness of your submission format and solution: PlannerVerifyOutput.py and MazeVerifyOutput.py. Both of these scripts accept ‚Äìalgorithm as a command-line argument. The following are a few examples that can help you understand how to invoke these scripts.

python PlannerVerifyOutput.py ‚Äì&gt; Tests all three algorithms on the all the MDP instances given to you in the data/mdp directory.

python PlannerVerifyOutput.py ‚Äìmdp ‚Äìalgorithm vi ‚Äì&gt; Tests only value iteration algorithm on the all the MDP instances given to you in the data/mdp directory. python MazeVerifyOutput.py ‚Äìmdp ‚Äìalgorithm vi ‚Äì&gt; Tests all the maze instances that are given in data/maze directory. Here, ‚Äìalgorithm specifies the algorithm that you would like to run on the MDP generated by encoder.py (we will check using value iteration).

These scripts assume the location of the data directory to be in the same directory. Run these scripts to check the correctness of your submission format. Your code should pass all the checks written in the script. You will be penalised if your code does not pass all the checks.

Your code for any of the algorithms should not take more than one minute to run on any test instance.

Prepare a short report.pdf in which you put your design decisions, assumptions, and observations about the algorithms (if any). Also mention how you formulated the MDP for the maze problem.

Place all the files in which you have written code in a directory named submission. Tar and Gzip the directory to produce a single compressed file (submission.tar.gz). It must contain the following files.

1. planner.py 2. encoder.py 3. decoder.py

4. report.pdf

5. references.txt

6. Any other files required to run your source code

Submit this compressed file on Moodle, under Programming Assignment 2.

Evaluation

We shall verify the correctness by computing and comparing optimal policies for a large number of unseen MDPs. If your code fails any test instances, you will be penalised based on the nature of the mistake made.

References for Linear Programming

For the Linear Programming part of the assignment, we recommend you to use the Python library PuLP. PuLP is convenient to use directly from Python code: here is a short tutorial and here is a reference.
